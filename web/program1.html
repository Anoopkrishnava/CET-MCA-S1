        <h2>Client/Server architecture</h2>
        <img src="client_server.png" height="300" width="500">
        <h3>Client Server Model</h3>
        <p>The Client-Server Model is a distributed architecture where clients request services and servers provide them.
            Clients send requests to servers, which process them and return the results. Clients donâ€™t share resources among themselves but depend on the server.
             Common examples include email systems and the World Wide Web, where clients (like browsers or email apps) interact with servers to access content or send data.</p>
        
        <h3>Client</h3>
        <p>When we talk about a "Client," it refers to a device that requests and receives services from a server
            . The client is the entity that initiates communication, asking for data or resources from the server. 
            For example, web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari are common client applications that request data from a server to render web pages.</p>
    
            <h3>Server</h3>
            <p>A Server, on the other hand, is a remote computer or system that provides data, resources or services to clients.
                 It listens to incoming client requests, processes them and sends the required information back.
                  A server can handle multiple client requests simultaneously.</p>

       <p>Web content encompasses all the information and digital media presented on a website. This includes text, images, videos, audio, and interactive elements. It can be broadly categorized into passive and interactive content, with various types like blog posts, product pages, case studies, and user-generated content falling under these categories</p>

       <h3>HTTP request</h3>
       <img src="HTTP_REQUEST.JPG" height="300" width="500">
       <p>
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser) to a server to request a resource or to perform an action on a resource. It is a fundamental component of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data exchange on the World Wide Web.
</p>
<h4>HTTP method</h4>
<ul>
    <li>GET:  Retrieves data from the server.</li>
    <li>POST: Sends data to the server, often to create a new resource.</li>
    <li>PUT: Replaces the entire content of a resource at a specific URI. </li>
    <li>PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource. </li>
    <li>DELETE: Removes a resource from the server. </li>
    <li>HEAD: Requests only the headers of a resource, without the body. </li>
    <li>OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dynamic web pages</h3>
<img src="dynamic_website.png" height="300" width="500">
<p>
Dynamic web pages are web pages whose content can change and adapt based on various factors, such as user interaction, time of day, database information, or other variables. Unlike static web pages, which deliver the same pre-built content to every visitor, dynamic pages offer a personalized and interactive experience.

<h3>Application Servers</h3>
<img src="application_servers.jpg" height="300" width="500">

<p>An application server is a type of server that hosts applications or software, delivering business applications to clients through communication protocols. It sits between the web server (or client) and the database, handling application logic, managing resources, and facilitating interaction between the user interface and the backend database.
